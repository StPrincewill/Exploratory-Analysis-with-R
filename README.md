The Canadian Federal Election of 2015 was overseen and administered by Elections Canada. There are 338 electoral districts in Canada, each with several candidates (one for each party and independents) running to win the right to represent that electoral district. 

The intention here is to examine the election results from across Canada at an electoral district level and  to generate some descriptive numbers regarding the previous election results.
